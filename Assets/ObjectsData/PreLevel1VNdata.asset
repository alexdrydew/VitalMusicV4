      What: Nothing changes from day to day.
    - Character: 1
      What: The grey city outside the window, things scattered all over the apartment,
        and a pointless attempt to find something to do in the interval between awakening
        and sleep.

      What: Hey, David, how're you? I'm glad to hear you still alive. Help me out,
        you're the only one I can turn to.
    - Character: 0
      What: The album release is in just a hour. They left yesterday to celebrate
        it, having decided they would finish the piano part in the morning, but they
        got down tonight so hard that the pianist broke his arm.
    - Character: 0
      What: We can't postpone the release in any way. Definitely can't. We have already
        agreed with all music platforms, and they want to launch it in Prime time.
    - Character: 0
      What: If we don't make it, I'm bankrupt!
    - Character: 0
      What: David, finish the piano part. I do need your help. The piano part should
        be the same as on the guitar.
    - Character: 0
      What: The work is simple, but it is necessary to be in time. I pay 1000$. OK?
        Agreed.
